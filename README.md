# sklearn_tweets
Capture tweets based on keywords, create targets for those tweets based on sentiment analysis, then process, train and fit the tweets and sentiment scores are training date for Sci-kit learn. 

# Purpose
Often times when experimenting with machine learning on text data in Scikit-Learn you practice by using static datasets like 20News.
This can create a misinformed view on the model fitting and f1 score reports of real world, changing data. This demo is designed
to capture tweets in real-time, analyze their sentiment in real-time and create a dataset of filtered tweets as the training data (X) with ranked sentiment scores as the target data (y).
